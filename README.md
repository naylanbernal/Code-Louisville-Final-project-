Hello, Welcome to my website project!


My website is about the different breeds of dogs, here you find and search for their different characteristics and varieties of dogs.

When you open my project at the top you will find the title of my website.

Then you will see a search bar that you can use to access the description of each dog.

Below there is a question about what a dog breed is and its answer.

Then you will find images of each of the dogs with their names so you can visually identify which one is your favorite.
When you click on the images of the dogs, it will take you to the bottom of the page with more information about their characteristics.

There is also a button that takes you to a form in case you have any questions about dog breeds or this page.


At the end of the page there is button named TOP, that when you click on it, it will take you to the top of the page.



Features

1. Use arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed in your app.
. I used the API to store raw data from it
using arrays and objects to use them later

2. Analyze data that is stored in arrays, objects, sets or maps and display information about it in your app.
. I analyzed the data to be able to create a search bar 
and give functionality and also provide information about the 
breed that the user is looking for when is clicked on the image 
or any list item

3. Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.
. I used this feature using this API: https://dogapi.dog/api/v2/breeds
